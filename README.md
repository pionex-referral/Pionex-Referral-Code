## What is a Pionex Referral Code?

A Pionex referral code is a unique alphanumeric string provided to existing users, which they can share with new users signing up for the platform. When a new user enters this code during registration, both the referrer and the referred individual unlock specific rewards. Pionex, launched in 2019, is renowned for its 16 free built-in trading bots and low trading fees of just 0.05% for both makers and takers. The referral program is designed to grow its community while rewarding users for their participation.

The referral code system is a win-win: new users gain bonuses like discounted fees or sign-up rewards, while existing users earn commissions based on their referrals’ trading activity. This makes it an attractive feature for both beginners and seasoned traders looking to optimize their experience on Pionex.
